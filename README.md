## üìú Description

This project is a web-based implementation of Sokoban, the classic box-pushing puzzle game. The objective is simple: push all the boxes (`üì¶`) onto the target spots (`üéØ`). However, you can only push one box at a time, and you cannot pull them. This simple rule set leads to surprisingly complex and challenging puzzles.

This game was built from the ground up as part of a 30-day daily coding challenge, emphasizing rapid development, creative problem-solving, and the "vibe coding" philosophy.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **10 Challenging Levels:** A curated set of puzzles with increasing difficulty.
*   **Sleek, Modern UI:** A beautiful and responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS, featuring smooth animations and a pleasant aesthetic.
*   **Intuitive Controls:** Play using your keyboard (Arrow Keys or WASD) for a desktop experience.
*   **Move Counter:** Keep track of your moves and challenge yourself to solve puzzles more efficiently.
*   **Undo & Reset:** Made a mistake? Undo your last move with the 'U' key. Want a fresh start? Hit 'R' to reset the level instantly.
*   **Level Progression:** Automatically advance to the next level upon completion.
*   **Game Completion Screen:** A special congratulatory screen for finishing all the levels.

Here‚Äôs how AI played a role:

*  Initially, the game logic was complex and buggy. AI helped refactor the entire state management system from a confusing, single-array model to a much cleaner, two-layer model (static layout + dynamic entities), which fixed the win condition and made the code more robust.
* When some of my initial, self-made levels turned out to be unsolvable, AI provided a set of classic, verified, and solvable Sokoban puzzles to use as a reliable data source.
